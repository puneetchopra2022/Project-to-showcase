Setup Docker Host on user defined Network

- [x] Use Case : Customer wants to Setup an Docker Host networks on User define IP address so that containers will launch followed specify IP Ranges.
- [x] Customer Provided Details : CIDR notation 192.168.100.1/24 
- [x] Way to check current Docker host IP details :  # ip address show docker0
- [x] Steps to Modify Existing docker host IP : 
      ** Its important to know IP address assigment follow the docker network drivers so by default we have bridge network driver that assign IP to Container & docker host but there is no direct vai to modify IP of bridge driver other way
         is to create an Custom bridge network driver with specific IP and launch an Container follow custom bridge driver.

     **Way to setup IP using Global method by making change under /etc/docker/daemon.json**  
          -> Stop an docker services #sudo systemctl stop docker
          -> Modify configuration file #sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json to include feild  "bip": "192.168.100.1/24" save an exist the daemon.json files 
              $ cat /etc/docker/daemon.json 
             {
                  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
                  "log-driver": "json-file",
                  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
                  "registry-mirrors": ["https://mirror.gcr.io","https://docker-mirror.killercoda.com","https://docker-mirror.killer.sh"],
                  "mtu": 1454,
                  "bip": "192.168.100.1/24"
             }
          -> start an docker services #sudo systemctl start docker
          -> verify services is started #sudo systemctl status docker (if failure reported kindly analize logs #journalctl -u docker  )
- [x] validate the changes for Docker host IP details :  # ip address show docker0
- [x] Run an docker container & validation assigned IP range for container using #docker inspect containerID command.
